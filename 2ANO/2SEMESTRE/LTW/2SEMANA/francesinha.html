                        Francesinha is a sandwich from northern Portugal, especially the Porto region.
                        It has two slices of bread and various meats, covered with melted cheese and served with sauce and fries.
                        The sauce is a unique part of the sandwich, with each restaurant having its own recipe made from tomatoes, broth, piri piri spices, beet and Port wine.
